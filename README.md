## Supported hardware

## Getting started

1. **Download** the factory image for your board from the table above.
2. **Flash** it with any ESP32 flasher — for example the browser-based [esptool-js](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/):
   - Use the outer USB-C port.
   - Baud rate `115200`, flash offset `0x0`.
   - The factory image includes the ESP32-C6 network coprocessor firmware.
3. **Reboot** the device. It opens a Wi-Fi AP called `BETTA-Setup`.
4. Connect to `BETTA-Setup`, open `http://192.168.4.1`, pick your country, scan for your network and save.
5. After reboot the panel joins your LAN. Open its IP in a browser, link Home Assistant via long-lived access token, and build your first page with **Quick Setup**.

Future updates install via OTA from the editor — no cable needed.

- **Dual panel support** — first release with dedicated `panel4` and `panel10` firmware images.

- **Web editor polish** — whole-tile row click targets, red-circle delete buttons with confirm dialogs, canvas auto-sizes to the selected panel variant.
- **Missing-entity diagnostics** — the editor shows a banner when layout entities are absent in Home Assistant; details at `/api/ha/diagnostics`.
