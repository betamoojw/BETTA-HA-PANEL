- Flash it with esptool or with a web flasher of your choice, for example: https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/

- Reboot the device by pressing the reset button or briefly cutting power.
- On first boot, the panel creates a setup access point named `BETTA-Setup`.
- Connect to `BETTA-Setup` and open http://192.168.4.1.
- Enter your Wi-Fi country/region code, scan for your network, enter the password, and save.
- After reboot, the panel joins your Wi-Fi and receives an IP address from your local network.
- Open that IP address in your browser to continue the Home Assistant setup and start configuring the dashboard.

## ESP-Hosted C6 Firmware Source

The original C6 adapter firmware used for this release was:

- https://github.com/esphome/esp-hosted-firmware/releases/tag/v2.11.7

Important:

- The C6 `network_adapter` firmware is already embedded into the generated factory image `betta86-ha-panel-<version>.factory.bin`.
- Running `tools/make_factory_bin.ps1` archives superseded factory images in `release/archive/`.
- For flashing/distribution, the factory image is sufficient.
- Keeping `network_adapter_esp32c6*.bin` in the repo is optional and not required for release delivery.

Project policy (build/runtime):

- Use C6 firmware only from `release/`.
- Do not auto-build C6 firmware in this repository.
- Trigger C6 OTA only when running version mismatches host version (including `0.0.0`).
